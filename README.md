# SQL-Employee-Tracker

## Purpose
To create a node.js app that can view and manage the departments, roles and employees of a company.

## Installation
git clone code from repo and clone into whichever folder you'd like. Make sure to create a .env file (and add .env to your .gitignore file) and add your mySQL credentials. Make sure to follow wording in connection.js.

## Usage
Once your code is cloned, open up a terminal and write - npm install - to install needed dependencies.
Open your mySQL shell and write - source db/db.sql; -
Then write - source db/schema.sql; -
Lastly, write - source db/seeds.sql; -

Once this is done, quit the mySQL shell and then write node index to start the application. Follow the prompts and enjoy :)

*Please feel free to change the database name, the tables and the seeds as needed. Just make sure the database name is also changed in the connection.js file.
